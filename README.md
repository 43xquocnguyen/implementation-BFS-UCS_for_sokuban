# All Implementations for Solving Sokuban Using DFS, BFS and UCS Algorithms

This project has 3 implementation for searching Sokuban solutions in `solver.py`:
* DFS: `depthFirstSearch(gameState)`
* BFS: `breadthFirstSearch(gameState)`
* UCS: `uniformCostSearch(gameState)`

For running: Run the `Sokuban.py` file.
